# d3-library-demo
> D3 Library Demo is a showcase of representative D3.js libraries

## Overview
This [demo](https://golodhros.github.io/d3-library-demo/) shows a limited set of libraries that represent different API styles applyed to D3.js code. The selected projects use one of the latest D3.js versions. They also feature high-quality code, broad test coverage or innovative approaches. They differ in the granularity of their abstractions (high, medium or low level) and the style of their API.
